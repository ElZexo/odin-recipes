    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="list">
      <li class="step">Place a single layer of eggplant slices in a colander sitting on a plate and sprinkle with coarse salt.
        Cover with a second layer and sprinkle with salt. Repeat with remaining eggplant.
        Place a plate on top and add a weight to put pressure on the eggplant slices.
        Let stand at room temperature for about 1 hour.</li>
      <li class="step">Rinse eggplant slices under running cold water to wash off all the salt.
        Pat dry on all sides with paper towels.</li>
      <li class="step">Heat oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat.
        Dredge eggplant slices in flour on both sides and add to the hot oil, working in batches.
        Deep fry eggplant until golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.</li>
      <li class="step">Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook garlic and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
        Add tomato puree, 4 basil leaves, and salt. Cook, stirring often, until sauce starts to thicken, about 20 minutes.
        Remove sauce from heat. Discard garlic and stir in remaining 4 leaves basil.</li>
      <li class="step">Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li class="step">Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the bottom of a baking dish. Cover with a single layer of eggplant slices.
        Top with more sauce, mozzarella slices, and Parmesan cheese.
        Continue making layers, a total of 3 to 5, finishing with tomato sauce and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
      <li class="step">Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and bubbling, 30 to 40 minutes.
        Remove from oven and let stand for 20 minutes before serving.</li>
