    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 eggplants</li>
      <li>coarse salt as needed</li>
      <li>5 cups of vegetal oil for frying</li>
      <li>flour for dredging</li>
      <li>half a bottle of tomato passata</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, halved</li>
      <li>a half onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>fresh basil leaves</li>
      <li>500g sliced cheese (mozzarella, scamorza)</li>
      <li>freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Place a single layer of eggplant slices in a colander sitting on a plate and sprinkle with coarse salt.<br />
        Cover with a second layer and sprinkle with salt. Repeat with remaining eggplant.<br />
        Place a plate on top and add a weight to put pressure on the eggplant slices.<br />
        Let stand at room temperature for about 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Rinse eggplant slices under running cold water to wash off all the salt.<br />
        Pat dry on all sides with paper towels.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge eggplant slices in flour on both sides and add to the hot oil, working in batches.<br />
        Deep fry eggplant until golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.</li>
      <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook garlic and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.<br />
        Add tomato puree, 4 basil leaves, and salt. Cook, stirring often, until sauce starts to thicken, about 20 minutes.<br />
        Remove sauce from heat. Discard garlic and stir in remaining 4 leaves basil.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the bottom of a baking dish. Cover with a single layer of eggplant slices.<br />
        Top with more sauce, mozzarella slices, and Parmesan cheese.<br />
        Continue making layers, a total of 3 to 5, finishing with tomato sauce and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and bubbling, 30 to 40 minutes.<br />
        Remove from oven and let stand for 20 minutes before serving.</li>
