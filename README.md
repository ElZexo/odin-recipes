# odin-recipes

I will use this repository to practice the HTML I studied in The Odin Project's HTML Foundations module. 
In detail I am going to create a simple recipes website, thus demonstrating my new grasp of the HTML boilerplate, text, lists, images, links.
I will top it off with frequent commits accompanied by detailed commit messages.
